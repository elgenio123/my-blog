Machine Learning (ML) allows computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. Hereâ€™s an introduction to the basics of ML.

### 1. What Is Machine Learning?

ML is a field of AI that uses algorithms to find patterns in data and make predictions based on those patterns.

### 2. Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning:** Uses labeled data to make predictions.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Uses feedback from actions to learn behavior.

### 3. Common Algorithms

Some common ML algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering.

### 4. Applications

ML is used in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, to build predictive models and automate tasks.

Machine Learning is a powerful tool that is transforming industries by enabling data-driven decision-making.
